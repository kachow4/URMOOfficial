                                is usually at the ARC Outdoor basketball 
                                courts, but will be TBD. These workshops are free!

                                Auditions will be held the Thursday of Week 7 at
                                Student Center Terrace. After turning in your audition 
                                application and audition fee, we will ask auditonees 
                                to perform the three audition pieces in groups of threes 
                                onstage in front of our judging panel. After all the rounds 
                                are complete, we will hold callbacks for certain groups. 
                                Afterwards, there will be an informal and optional cypher 
                                for auditonees to freestyle and show us any other tricks they may have!

                                to move on to the interview round through phone call or text. URMO board will 
                                let you know the time and location of your interview. Once all interviews have
                                been conducted, the roster should be released by late Saturday afternoon!
